		<h1>Braid Messages</h1>
		<p>All messages exchanged in braid have the same basic structure.  
		They are JSON-encoded objects using UTF-8 character encoding and 
		they have this structure:
		<pre>
{
   id: <span class='variable'>id</span>,
   to: <span class='variable'>recipients</span>,
   from: <span class='variable'>sender</span>,
   type: <span class='variable'>{cast | request | reply | error}</span>,
   request:  <span class='variable'>request type</span>,
   code: <span class='variable'>HTTP-style error code</span>,
   message: <span class='variable'>HTTP-style error message</span>,
   data: <span class='variable'>request-specific object</span>
}</pre>
		<p>Not all of these fields necessarily appear in every message.</p>
		
		<p>Here is an example of a ping request and corresponding response:<p>
		<pre>
{
   id: 5,
   to: [{
      user: 'bob',
      domain: 'example.org'
   }],
   from: {
      user: 'joe',
      domain: 'example.org'
   },
   type: 'request',
   request: 'ping'
}

{
   id: 5,
   to: [{
      user: 'joe',
      domain: 'example.org'
   }],
   from: {
      user: 'bob',
      domain: 'example.org'
   },
   type: 'reply',
   request: 'ping'
}</pre>
		
		
		<h3>id</h3>
		<p>This field, if present, contains a number used by a message sender to associate a reply
		or error message received with the original message that was sent.  This field does not appear
		in messages whose <span class='fieldName'>type</span> is <span class='fieldValue'>cast</span>.</p>
		<p>The sender can use any numbering scheme it chooses.  Those sending replies or errors copy the
		<span class='fieldName'>id</span> from the request into their response message.
		
		<h3>to</h3>
		<p>This field determines who the message will be delivered to.  If absent,
		the message is intended for the entity directly receiving it.  For example, a client sending a message
		to its domain server omits this field for messages intended for the server.<p>
		<p>The field contains an array of address objects.  A server receiving a message with multiple recipients
		is responsible for delivering one copy to each recipient within that domain, and one copy to each distinct
		external domain referenced.  For more about addressing, see <a href='braid-addresses.html'>Braid Addresses</a>.
		
		<h3>from</h3>
		<p>This field identifies who originated the message.  A client sending a message never includes this
		field, as its server will always populate it to ensure identity integrity.  For more about addressing, see 
		<a href='braid-addresses.html'>Braid Addresses</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>type</h3>
		<p>This field is mandatory and must contain one of the following strings:</p>
		<div class='enumList'>
			<div><div class='enumHeading'>cast</div>  Messages that are sent when no response is expected</div>
			<div><div class='enumHeading'>request</div>  Messages for which a response is expected</div>
			<div><div class='enumHeading'>reply</div>  A positive response to a <span class='fieldValue'>request</span> message</div>
			<div><div class='enumHeading'>cast</div>  Messages that are sent when no response is expected</div>
		</div>
		
		<h3>request</h3>
		<p>This field is mandatory and describes the primary intention of the message.  For <span class='fieldValue'>reply</span> 
		and <span class='fieldValue'>error</span> messages it is copied from the corresponding 
		<span class='fieldValue'>request</span> message.</p>
		<p>Braid defines a core set of request types but the protocol is extensible.  Servers are required to
		deliver messages even if the server does not recognize the value in the <span class='fieldValue'>request</span>
		field.  To avoid naming collisions, except for standard requests (see <a href='braid-addresses.html'>Braid Requests</a>)
		all requests must be expressed as a URL in a domain under the control of the person defining that request.  For
		example, if the Beatles wanted to define a new <span class='fieldValue'>increase-speed</span> request type, they
		could send a message like this:</p>
		<pre>
{
   id: 6,
   to: [{
      user: 'ringo',
      domain: 'beatles.org'
   }],
   from: {
      user: 'john',
      domain: 'beatles.org'
   },
   type: 'request',
   request: 'http://beatles.org/braid/increase-speed'
}
</pre>
		
		<h3>code and message</h3>
		<p>In <span class='fieldValue'>error</span> messages only, the responder explains the reason that they
		could not fulfill the request by providing an error code, using standard HTTP-style error codes, and
		a human-readable message.  For example, if someone receives a message whose request type is one they
		do not understand, the can return a message like this:</p>
				<pre>
{
   id: 6,
   to: [{
      user: 'john',
      domain: 'beatles.org'
   }],
   from: {
      user: 'ringo',
      domain: 'beatles.org'
   },
   type: 'error',
   request: 'http://beatles.org/braid/increase-volume',
   error: 406,
   message: 'This request type is not supported'
}
</pre>
